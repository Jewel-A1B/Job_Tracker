### 1. What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?
getElementById, getElementsByClassName, querySelector, and querySelectorAll are JavaScript methods used to find elements from an HTML page. getElementById is used to select one element using its id. getElementsByClassName is used to select all elements that have the same class name. querySelector uses a CSS selector and returns only the first matching element. querySelectorAll also uses a CSS selector, but it returns all matching elements. In simple words, getElementById finds one element by id, getElementsByClassName finds many elements by class, querySelector finds the first match, and querySelectorAll finds all matches.
